                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <p>Florence Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 into a wealthy and well-connected British family at the
                    Villa Colombaia, in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, and was named after the city of her birth. Florence's
                    older sister Frances Parthenope had similarly been named after her place of birth, Parthenope, a
                    Greek
                    settlement now part of the city of Naples. The family moved back to England in 1821, with
                    Nightingale
                    being brought up in the family's homes at Embley, Hampshire, and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire.</p>

                <h2>Crimean War</h2>
                <p>Florence Nightingale's most famous contribution came during the Crimean War, which became her central
                    focus when reports got back to Britain about the horrific conditions for the wounded. On 21 October
                    1854, she and the staff of 38 women volunteer nurses that she trained, including her aunt Mai Smith,
                    and
                    15 Catholic nuns (mobilised by Henry Edward Manning) were sent (under the authorisation of Sidney
                    Herbert) to the Ottoman Empire. Nightingale was assisted in Paris by her friend Mary Clarke. They
                    were
                    deployed about 295 nautical miles (546 km; 339 mi) across the Black Sea from Balaklava in the
                    Crimea,
                    where the main British camp was based.</p>
